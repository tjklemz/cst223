# CST223

A repo for the code we go over in lecture.

For C++:
- Be sure to use the latest C++, such as C++20 or C++23
- I recommend the LLVM compiler
- Make doesn't require a Makefile. You can run most code by `make <file>` (without `.cpp`) and then `./<file>` (again without `.cpp`)

For JavaScript (JS):
- Download and install NodeJS from here: https://nodejs.org/en/
- In a terminal where your code is, run `node <myfile>.js`
- Or, to simply open a REPL, type `node`
- The package manager is `npm`. You can explore here: https://www.npmjs.com/

More to be added as we continue...
